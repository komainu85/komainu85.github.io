    <p>With Sitecore 8.1 we get access to a brand new version of SPEAK, the shiny SPEAK 2.0.</p>
<p>In this blog post we will look at creating a new SPEAK component using the 2.0 framework. We will compare the same SPEAK component built against version 1.0 and 2.0 to see the differences the new framework makes to development.<!--more--></p>
<blockquote><p>Its worth noting that SPEAK 1.1 can still be used within Sitecore 8.1. But a SPEAK application has to be fully built against a single SPEAK version, you can't mix components of different versions.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Enabling SPEAK 2.0 in a SPEAK application</h2>
<p>To use the new version of SPEAK, within the PageCode of your SPEAK application the SpeakCoreVersion property has to be set to Speak Core 2-0. This setting will load in the SPEAK core javascript files for SPEAK 2.0 into your application.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_930" align="aligncenter" width="225"]<a href="https://mikerobbinssitecore.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/speak-page-code.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-930" src="/assets/speak-page-code.png?w=225" alt="SPEAK 2.0 Page Code" width="225" height="300" /></a> SPEAK 2.0 Page Code[/caption]</p>
<p>All SPEAK 2.0 components within the version 2 folder in the Business Component Library and sit alongside the version 1 files. "sitecore\shell\client\Business Component Library\version 2\Layouts\Renderings".</p>
<p>Within Sitecore Rocks, SPEAK 2.0 components can be identified by the SPEAK Core 2-0 tag in the add renderings dialog.</p>

<h2>Custom SPEAK components</h2>
<p>So onto the main subject of this blog post, creating a new custom SPEAK component with SPEAK 2.0. The code samples below are of a Rich Text Editor component built against both SPEAK 1.1 and SPEAK 2.0.</p>
<h3>SPEAK 1.1 Component</h3>
<h4>Cshtml File</h4>
<p>This is when the HTML is defined and properties from our parameter template for component in Sitecore are mapped into attributes on our control.</p>
<p>In this example we are getting parameters such as the height from the parameter template in Sitecore using rendering.GetString(<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>Height<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>Height<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>, <span class="pl-k">string</span>.Empty); and setting the value into a data attribute rendering.Attributes[<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>data-sc-height<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>].</p>
<h4>Javascript File</h4>
<p>We firstly use Require.js to import our JavaScript dependencies.</p>
<p>After the standard SPEAK component framework mark-up, we initialize the model for the component, setting each of its properties to null.</p>
<p>In the view initialize function we need to set each model property from the data attribute we created in the cshtml.</p>
<p>https://gist.github.com/komainu85/a7bd9bd4cc56baceec49</p>
<h3>SPEAK 2.0 Component</h3>
<p>With SPEAK 2.0 much of the heavy lifting and plumbing code is handled by Sitecore SPEAK, we can concentrate more on our component logic.</p>
<h4>Model</h4>
<p>The biggest change between 1.1 and 2.0 is the inclusion of a server side model. This model represents our rendering parameters for our component. We inherit from the CollectionBaseRenderingModel base class and create a property for each of our rendering parameters, matching their name.</p>
<p>Within Sitecore Rocks for our component we can specific the class in the model field.</p>
<h4>Cshtml File</h4>
<p>As you can see in the Cshtml file it is much cleaner. Sitecore SPEAK is handling all the plumbing between our parameter template and our model.</p>
<p>We simply need to specify our @model to our model class. All properties will be populated by Sitecore at runtime.</p>
<p>We can require in our JavaScript for the component. Here I'm removing the standard location that Sitecore looks for my JavaScript, and re-adding the reference in a custom location. I do this not to clash with Sitecore default components.</p>
<h4>JavaScript File</h4>
<p>With the JavaScript code file the syntax has changed quite a bit. Again Sitecore SPEAK is handling a lot of the plumbing code for us. We no longer need to wire up each of the model properties ourselves. Sitecore will automatically populate each property for us.</p>
<p>The way properties are also accessed in a different way. In SPEAK 1.1 we had to access properties via the view model E.g. <span class="pl-v">this</span>.model.viewModel.<span class="pl-c1">height</span>(). In SPEAK 2.0 this has been simplified to this.Height</p>
