<p>Very quick post post, I know this has been catching a number of people out. Such as this Stack Overflow question. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33020451/sitecore-speak-and-javascript/33023142#33023142">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33020451/sitecore-speak-and-javascript/33023142#33023142</a><!--more--></p>
<p>When debugging Sitecore SPEAK in Sitecore 7.x (query string ?sc_debug=1)  you could access and debug your SPEAK application in your console browser via Sitecore.app. When trying this in Sitecore 7.5 and 8 you will get "undefined" returned.</p>
<blockquote><p>In Sitecore 7.5 and 8.x Sitecore.app has been moved. The new namespace is Sitecore.Speak.app.</p></blockquote>
